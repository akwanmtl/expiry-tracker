# Food LifeSaver

## Description
This application is an Expiry Tracker and a Shopping List Application built using MongoDB, Express, Vue and Node. Buefy is the CSS Framework. The motivation behind this project is primary to learn how to use the Vue.JS framework. In addition, I always wanted to address the problem of remembering what foods I have.

There is also a shopping list feature. Once you finish a food item, you can either remove it from the expiry list or add it to your shopping cart. There is also a simple stats page to show you how much food you have wasted vs finished.
